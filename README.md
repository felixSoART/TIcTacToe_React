Its the well known game TicTacToe developed by me under the React web tutorial trying to stylish it a little bit and with additional features such as a shift highlight on the bottom of the table,
a play again button in the table and also once the game is over.
You can also toggle if you want the symbol of the shift to appear following you cursor creating a cool effect.
